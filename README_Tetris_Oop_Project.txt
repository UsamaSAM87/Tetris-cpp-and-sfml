Code Description:
The folder conatins two solutions one that is for visual studio 15 (2017 Version) & the other folder contains visual studio 16 (2019 Version)
The code is built in and for Visual studio 2017 and runs properly. However, it was modified for Visual Studio 2019 & it runs fine for it also.
You can run the code on any version but we recommend you to run it on Visual Studio 2017.
The folder conatins three header files i.e box.h, piece.h, board.h and a main.cpp file
The header file (box.h) contains a class that contains the functions for the movement of piece on the board.
The header file (piece.h) contains functions used to generate the peice and its formations.
The header file (board.h) contains functions that create the board and other functions that perform several activities of peices on game board.
The main.cpp contains the board.h called and all the graphics functions.


How to RUN the Code:
The code is built using SFML & TGUI graphics library.
You have to download SFML(2.5.1-2017-32bit) and TGUI(0.8.8-2017-32bit) from their websites
We have built the code on Visual Studio 2017 as SFML was last released for VS 2017.
Open either folder VS17 or VS19.(The one in which you want to run the program). 
After successful setup of SFML & TGUI lib, include, bin, linker; just press run and compiler will build and run the code.
Note:  SFML and TGUI versions will be the same for both VS17 & VS19.
